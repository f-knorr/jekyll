  abstract = {The merging of two lanes is a common traffic scenario. In this paper we derive a formal model for the behavior of vehicles in this scenario. We discuss the question of how fairness of a merging process can be defined and introduce the notion of free-flow fairness. We first show how optimal fairness could be achieved if all vehicles were omniscient and willing to follow a given strategy. We then move to a more realistic setting, where only a subset of vehicles participates in our merging scheme and where wireless communication is limited and unreliable. By means of analysis and simulation we show that a simple beacon-based approach yields very good fairness even if only one percent of the vehicles participate.},

  abstract = {We present a very simple stochastic traffic cellular automaton (CA) model to reproduce synchronized traffic. This model aims to be nearly as simple as the well-known Nagel–Schreckenberg model, but to overcome to shortcomings of the latter: The Nagel–Schreckenberg model (NaSch) and its variants achieve collision-free driving by explicitly allowing for unlimited braking capabilities. However, it is rather natural to view the collision-free traffic flow as a consequence of moderate driving instead of infinite braking capabilities. Therefore, our new \{CA\} model limits the vehicles’ acceleration and deceleration rates to realistic values. Moreover, our model is able to reproduce several important features of synchronized traffic flow. Earlier models achieve identical goals only by using relatively complicated rules of motion. Our model, however, introduces slight modifications of the easily comprehensible NaSch. These modifications lead to very stable states where all vehicles tend to synchronize their speed. Even though, or perhaps precisely because, the states of synchronized flow are stable in our model, it allows to study several features of this traffic phase in great detail.},

  abstract = {Despite its simplicity, the Nagel-Schreckenberg (NaSch) traffic cellular automaton is able to reproduce empirically observed traffic phenomena such as spontaneous traffic jam formation. Most traffic cellular automata models achieve collision-free driving by explicitly allowing for unlimited braking capabilities. However, it is rather natural to view the collision-free traffic flow as a consequence of moderate driving instead of infinite braking capabilities. Lee et al. (Phys Rev Lett 23:238702, 2004) introduced a traffic model that limits the vehicles’ acceleration and deceleration rates to realistic values. The underlying rules of motion in this model are, however, quite complicated. In this article, we introduce and analyse a modified version of the NaSch traffic model with simple rules of motion and limited braking capabilities. We achieve collision-free driving with realistic deceleration rates by the introduction of the function μ which determines a vehicle’s new speed depending on the preceding vehicle’s speed and the distance d to its predecessor. After proving that this function limits the maximum deceleration rate to realistic values and guarantees the collision-freeness at the same time, we investigate the resulting traffic dynamics.},

  abstract = {We study a system with two types of interacting particles on a one-dimensional lattice. Particles of the first type, which we call 'active', are able to detect particles of the second type (called 'passive'). By relating the problem to a discrete random walk in one dimension with a fixed number of steps we determine the fraction of active and detected particles for both open and periodic boundary conditions as well as for the case where passive particles interact with both or only one neighbors. In the random walk picture, where the two particles types stand for steps in opposite directions, passive particles are detected whenever the resulting path has a corner. For open boundary conditions, it turns out that a simple mean field approximation reproduces the exact result if the particles interact with one neighbor only. A practical application of this problem is heterogeneous traffic flow with communicating and non-communicating vehicles. In this context communicating vehicles can be thought of as active particles which can by front (and rear) sensors detect the vehicle ahead (and behind) although these vehicles do not actively share information. Therefore, we also present simulation results which show the validity of our analysis for real traffic flow.},

  abstract={We study the spatiotemporal patterns resulting from different boundary conditions for a microscopic traffic model and contrast them with empirical results. By evaluating the time series of local measurements, the local traffic states are assigned to the different traffic phases of Kerner's three-phase traffic theory. For this classification we use the rule-based FOTO-method, which provides 'hard' rules for this assignment. Using this approach, our analysis shows that the model is indeed able to reproduce three qualitatively different traffic phases: free flow (F), synchronized traffic (S), and wide moving jams (J). In addition, we investigate the likelihood of transitions between the three traffic phases. We show that a transition from free flow to a wide moving jam often involves an intermediate transition: first from free flow to synchronized flow and then from synchronized flow to a wide moving jam. This is supported by the fact that the so-called F-to-S transition (from free flow to synchronized traffic) is much more likely than a direct F-to-J transition. The model under consideration has a functional relationship between traffic flow and traffic density. The fundamental hypothesis of the three-phase traffic theory, however, postulates that the steady states of synchronized flow occupy a two-dimensional region in the flow–density plane. Due to the obvious discrepancy between the model investigated here and the postulate of the three-phase traffic theory, the good agreement that we found could not be expected. For a more detailed analysis, we also studied vehicle dynamics at a microscopic level and provide a comparison of real detector data with simulated data of the identical highway segment.},

We investigate the role of pre-trip information on the resulting route usage dynamics. Besides the absence of a stable equilibrium point (Wardrop's User Equilibrium), we found that the participants improve their decisions over the course of time as a result of learning. Additional information appears only useful if only a limited number of participants possess such information. Moreover, we found gender-related differences in the observed road usage patterns: female participants were more likely to choose the toll road than male participants.},

  abstract = {Traffic flow is a very prominent example of a driven non-equilibrium system,
which shows a very complex spatiotemporal dynamics. A characteristic
phenomenon of traffic dynamics is the spontaneous and abrupt drop of the
average velocity on a stretch of road leading to congestion.
To assess the quality of three selected microscopic traffic models (the Nagel-
Schreckberg model (NSM), the intelligent driver model (IDM), and the
comfortable driving model (CDM)), we study their ability to reproduce such
a traffic breakdown, whose spatiotemporal dynamics we investigate as well.
Our analysis is based on empirical traffic data from stationary loop detectors
showing a spontaneous breakdown on a German Autobahn. We then present
several methods to assess the results and to compare the models with each
other. In addition, we will also discuss some important modeling aspects
and their impact on the resulting spatiotemporal pattern.
For the CDM, which gave good results in this assessment, we analyze the
spatiotemporal patterns resulting from different inflow and outflow rates
with open boundary conditions. Based on time series of local measurements,
the local traffic states are assigned to different traffic phases according
to Kerner’s three-phase traffic theory. For this classification we use the
rule-based FOTO-method, which was developed by Kerner et al. Our
analysis shows that the model is indeed able to reproduce three qualitatively
different traffic phases: free flow, synchronized traffic, and wide moving jams.
This is surprising because traffic models with a fundamental diagram, such
as the CDM, are not expected to reproduce the synchronized phase.
By virtue of this overall good agreement with empirical findings, we chose
the CDM to investigate via computer simulations how traffic congestion
can be reduced with the help of vehicle-to-vehicle communication. As the
reasons for a traffic breakdown are perturbations caused by human drivers
in dense traffic, we propose using periodically emitted status messages to
analyze traffic flow and to warn other drivers of a possible traffic breakdown.
Drivers who receive such a warning are told to keep a larger gap to their
predecessor. By doing so, they are less likely the source of perturbations,
which can cause a traffic breakdown. We show that penetration rates of
10 percent and less can have significant influence on traffic flow and travel times.
Finally, we address a rather practical problem of heterogeneous traffic con-
sisting of communicating and non-communicating vehicles. If communicating
vehicles can detect the vehicle ahead (and behind) by front (and rear) sensors,
we give exact solutions for the average number of detected vehicles.},
